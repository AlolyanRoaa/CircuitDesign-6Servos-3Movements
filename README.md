# Circuit Design with 6 Servos and 3 Movements


This is a circuit design with 6 servos and 3 movements for the evaluation robot to control his arms.

This project has done using Tinkercad

## Servo Description

*please note: in this design, a micro servo is used. but for the robot arm project, a different servo will be used.*

| Servo  | description |
